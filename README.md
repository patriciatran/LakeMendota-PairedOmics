**Overall project objective**:
The overall goal of this project is to understand the spatio-temporal contribution of microbial (bacteria, archaea, and viruses) in lake biogeochemical cycling, specifically in anoxic lakes.

# üñ•Ô∏è Data Availability

**Data release**: This is data from a JGI Project CSP New-Investigator written by Patricia Tran and Karthik Anantharaman ([award DOI: 10.46936/10.25585/60001327](https://www.osti.gov/award-doi-service/biblio/10.46936/10.25585/60001327)) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, obtained in 2020. This is data that I collected and generated as part of my PhD thesis in Freshwater and Marine Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

## The data is released to the public and is under 2 year embargo.
