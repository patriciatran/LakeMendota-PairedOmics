**Purpose of this document**:

This goal of this document is to detail the steps of my analysis of my various datasets. I also tried to wrote it in a "tutorial" format that someone could follow along if they were to do a similar analysis. It's broken down in multiple sections for the metagenomes, viromes and metatranscriptomes analyses. I also added some "tips" in there that I tended to always Google and came back to often. I hope this document is useful to you!

The overall goal of this project is to understand the spatio-temporal contribution of microbial (bacteria, archaea, and viruses) in lake biogeochemical cycling, specifically in anoxic lakes.

# üñ•Ô∏è Data Availability

**Data release**: This is data from a JGI Project CSP New-Investigator written by Patricia Tran and Karthik Anantharaman ([award DOI: 10.46936/10.25585/60001327](https://www.osti.gov/award-doi-service/biblio/10.46936/10.25585/60001327)) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, obtained in 2020. This is data that I collected and generated as part of my PhD thesis in Freshwater and Marine Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

## The data is released to the public and is under 2 year embargo.

## üß¨¬†Data Availability

The MAGs can be accessed on BioProject PRJNA758276. Under this Bioproject can be accessed all the 431 prokaryotic metagenome-assembled genomes, and the processed 16 RNA-seq samples. The phage genomes can be accessed at 10.6084/m9.figshare.22213846. (note to reviewers: private link is [https://figshare.com/s/9502a09fdba078edda07](https://figshare.com/s/9502a09fdba078edda07) ).
